    == Overview

    Business application can be defined as an automated solution, built with selected frameworks and capabilities that implements business functions and/or business problems. Capabilities can be (among others):

    * persistence
    * messaging
    * transactions
    * business processes, business rules
    * planning solutions

    Business application is more of a logical grouping of individual services that represent certain business capabilities.
    Usually they are deployed separately and can also be versioned individually. Overall goal is that the complete business
    application will allow particular domain to achieve their business goals e.g. order management, accommodation management, etc.

    .Business application is

    * Build on any runtime
    * Deployable to cloud with just single command
    * UI agnostic (doesnâ€™t enforce any UI frameworks and let users to make their own choice)
    * Configurable database profiles
    * Generated

    .Business application consists of (though are not restricted to have only one of each project types)

    * data model project - shared data model between business assets and service
    * business assets (kjar) project - easily importable into workbench
    * service project - actual service with various capabilities

    *Service project* is the one that is deployable but will in most of the cases include business assets and data model projects.

    *Data model project* represents the common data structures that will be shared between service implementation and
    business assets. That enables proper encapsulation and promotes reuse and at the same time reduces shortcuts to make
    data model classes something more than they are - include too much of implementation into data models.

    *Business assets project* represents your business logic as processes, cases, rules, decision tables and more.

    == Build your first Business Application

    To build your first business application simply go to https://start.jbpm.org[start.jbpm.org, window="_blank"] and generate the application.

    There are two options you can get your application

    * Generate default application - that gives you all default settings to get started as fast as possible
    * Configure projects and capabilities - that gives you few options to select from before generating application

    Once you have the application on your computer just follow these steps to have it up and running

    * unzip downloaded archive and go into unzipped directory
    * go to directory suffixed with -service
    * execute `./launch.sh clean install` for unix or `launch.bat clean install` for windows
    * once the boot has finished go to http://localhost:8090[http://localhost:8090, window="_blank"]
