== Overview

Business application can be defined as an automated solution, built with selected frameworks and capabilities that implements business functions and/or business problems. Capabilities can be (among others):

* persistence
* messaging
* transactions
* business processes, business rules
* planning solutions

Business application is more of a logical grouping of individual services that represent certain business capabilities.
Usually they are deployed separately and can also be versioned individually. Overall goal is that the complete business
application will allow particular domain to achieve their business goals e.g. order management, accommodation management, etc.

.Business application is

* Build on any runtime
* Deployable to cloud with just single command
* UI agnostic (doesn’t enforce any UI frameworks and let users to make their own choice)
* Configurable database profiles
* Generated

.Business application consists of (though are not restricted to have only one of each project types)

* data model project - shared data model between business assets and service
* business assets (kjar) project - easily importable into workbench
* service project - actual service with various capabilities

*Service project* is the one that is deployable but will in most of the cases include business assets and data model projects.

*Data model project* represents the common data structures that will be shared between service implementation and
business assets. That enables proper encapsulation and promotes reuse and at the same time reduces shortcuts to make
data model classes something more than they are - include too much of implementation into data models.

*Business assets project* represents your business logic as processes, cases, rules, decision tables and more.

Following are the maven archetype commands need to be used to generate different types of projects:

* Data model archetype

[source, bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-model-archetype -DarchetypeVersion={COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL} -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=business-application-model -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company.model
----

`org.apache.maven.archetypes:maven-archetype-quickstart:1.3`

* Business assets project archetype

[source, bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-kjar-archetype -DarchetypeVersion={COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL} -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=business-application-kjar -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company
----
`org.kie:kie-kjar-archetype:{COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL}`

* Dynamic assets project archetype

[source, bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-kjar-archetype -DarchetypeVersion={COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL} -DcaseProject=true -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=business-application-kjar -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company
----
`org.kie:kie-kjar-archetype:{COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL}`

* Service project archetype can be used based on the capabilities that are needed in the project:

* Service project archetype(Business Automation)

[source, bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-service-spring-boot-archetype -DarchetypeVersion={COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL} -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=business-application-service -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company.service -DappType=bpm
----
`org.kie:kie-service-spring-boot-archetype:{COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL}`

* Service project archetype(Decision Management)

[source, bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-service-spring-boot-archetype -DarchetypeVersion={COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL} -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=business-application-service -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company.service -DappType=brm
----
`org.kie:kie-service-spring-boot-archetype:{COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL}`

* Service project archetype(Business Optimization)

[source, bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-service-spring-boot-archetype -DarchetypeVersion={COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL} -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=business-application-service -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company.service -DappType=planner
----
`org.kie:kie-service-spring-boot-archetype:{COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL}`


== Build your first Business Application

To build your first business application,use the above mentioned maven archetype commands to generate a Data project,Business assets project and a Service project with desired capabilities.

It is recommended to generate all the three types of projects -Data Model, Business assets and Service projects using the archetypes in same directory on your computer.

Once you have the application on your computer just follow these steps to have it up and running

* go to directory suffixed with -service
* execute `./launch.sh clean install` for unix or `launch.bat clean install` for windows
* once the boot has finished go to http://localhost:8090[http://localhost:8090, window="_blank"]
