*Introduction*

Hi, my name is Kris Verlaenen and  I'm a *principal architect* in the Application Services group at Red Hat!  I've been at Red Hat for over 15 years, and
most of my focus has been on technologies related to Business Automation, with a particular interest on runtimes for workflow and business process management.

I'm the https://jbpm.org[jBPM] *project lead*, one of the largest open-source BPM engines out there, and I've been part of the project since 2010.  I've written large parts
of the core workflow engine, and a lot of that code is still in use today (albeit often with many improvements along the way)!

I'm also the https://kogito.kie.org[Kogito] *project lead*, an open-source cloud-native solution for business automation, the next generation of process automation
based on jBPM, Drools and Optaplanner, targeting the cloud.  It's built from the ground up to be cloud-native, and integrates closely with the cloud-native
ecosystem (Kubernetes, Quarkus, Knative, Camel-K, etc.).  Most of my recent focus is on working with partners, both inside and outside of Red Hat, on making this
vision a reality.

These open-source community projects are also the bases for *Red Hat Business Automation Manager*, and I work closely with product management, support and directly
with many customers.

Moving beyond the traditional Business Automation space, I'm also focused on Serverless Workflow, integrating Kogito into knative and the broader cloud-native
ecosystem for service orchestration use cases.

I have an interest in a broad range of topics:

* workflow and business processes
* rules and decision management
* cloud-native services
* managed services
* quarkus, knative
* BPMN, serverless workflow, choreography
* open source
* clinical decision support
