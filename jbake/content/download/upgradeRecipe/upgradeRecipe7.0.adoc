= Upgrade recipe 7.0

== Backwards incompatible changes to the public API

Because this is a new major version number (7.0), which is the foundation for the 7.x series for the next few years,
it allows us to make backwards incompatible changes to the public API _for the long term benefit of this project_.

Our current intention is to keep these backwards incompatible changes to a strict minimum
(by favoring deprecation over removal) and do not introduce any additional ones after 7.0.

Any backwards incompatible changes are annotated with a [.label.label-danger.label-as-badge.label-public-api]#Public API# badge.


== From 6.5.0.Final to 7.0.0.Final

=== Java 8 or higher required

If you're using JRE or JDK 6 or 7, upgrade to JDK 8 or higher.

We currently intend to support a minimal version of Java 8 throughout the entire 7.x series.

=== OSGi integration artifacts renamed

OSGi integration artifacts were renamed from `drools-\*` to `kie-*`. We have also renamed the Java package names from
`org.drools.osgi` to org `org.kie.osgi.`. The main reason for these changes is that the artifacts no longer contain just
Drools specific code, but also jBPM and OptaPlanner OSGi integration (KIE is the umbrella term for those three projects).
The change affects `drools-osgi-integration` Maven artifact, Karaf features file URL and Spring's `OsgiKModuleBeanFactoryPostProcessor`:

Before in `pom.xml`:
[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.drools</groupId>
  <artifactId>drools-osgi-integration</artifactId>
  <version>6.5.0.Final</version>
</dependency>
----

After in `pom.xml`:
[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie</groupId>
  <artifactId>kie-osgi-integration</artifactId>
  <version>7.0.0.Final</version>
</dependency>
----

Before when using Karaf features file:
[source,shell]
----
features:addurl mvn:org.drools/drools-karaf-features/6.5.0.Final/xml/features
----

After when using Karaf features files:
[source]
----
features:addurl mvn:org.kie/kie-karaf-features/7.0.0.Beta2/xml/features
----

Before in Spring configuration file:
[source, xml]
----
<bean id="kiePostProcessor" class="org.drools.osgi.spring.OsgiKModuleBeanFactoryPostProcessor"/>
----

After in Spring configuration file:
[source, xml]
----
<bean id="kiePostProcessor" class="org.kie.osgi.spring.OsgiKModuleBeanFactoryPostProcessor"/>

=== KIE Drools Workbench WARs renamed
The KIE Drools Workbench WARs were renamed from `kie-drools-wb-distribution-wars-<version>-<container>.war`
to just `kie-drools-wb-<version>-<container>.war`. In case you depend directly on the Maven GAV you need to change
the `artifactId`:

Before in `pom.xml`:
[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie</groupId>
  <artifactId>kie-drools-wb-distribution-wars</artifactId>
  <version>6.5.0.Final</version>
  <type>war</type>
  <classifier>wildfly10</classifier>
</dependency>
----

After in `pom.xml`:
[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie</groupId>
  <artifactId>kie-drools-wb</artifactId>
  <version>7.0.0.Final</version>
  <type>war</type>
  <classifier>wildfly10</classifier>
</dependency>
